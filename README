libnss-openvpn
==============

The libnss-openvpn name service switch module resolves the name
“xxx.vpn” to the associated xxx machine in the openvpn.server.status
file.

With this module, you can access to a given host from the openvpn server
even if the IP address is not static.

$ ssh foobar.vpn

You don't need a ccd directory per host any more.

Manual installation
===================

$ make && make install

To make the system actually use this NSS module, add it to the list of
hosts modules in /etc/nsswitch.conf:

hosts:          files dns openvpn

If you want users to be able to use the module, you will probably
need to relax the security of openvpn.server.status:

# chmod 644 /var/run/openvpn.server.status
